# Skybox Gen 1

Kinda a failed attempt.
Please read [the comments in] star.glsl for interesting maths!

The stars warp and become pointy if you get too close, and I think that's an unavoidable unforeseen consequence of what I'm doing, and that's fine.
I'll just rotate planes towards the camera to draw the stars as squares.
